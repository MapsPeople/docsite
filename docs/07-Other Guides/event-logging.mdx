:::danger Known iOS Issues

1. Developing on the new Arm-based Apple Silicon (M1) Macs requires building and running on a physical iOS device or using an iOS simulator running iOS 13.7, e.g. iPhone 11. This is a temporary limitation in Google Maps SDK for iOS, and as such also a limitation in MapsIndoors, due to the dependency to Google Maps.
1. Note: Due to [a bug in CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/7155) it is necessary to include the `post_install` hook in your Podfile described in the [PodFile post_install](https://github.com/MapsIndoors/MapsIndoorsIOS/wiki/Podfile-post_install) wiki.
