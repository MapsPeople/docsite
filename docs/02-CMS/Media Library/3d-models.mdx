3D models in your MapsIndoors solution are uploaded and managed through [the Media Library](/cms-media-library) just like 2D models and icons. However, due to the nature of 3D models, there are a few additional steps to manage, particularly when uploading your 3D model.

## Set Preview Image

Most notably, when you upload a new 3D model to the Media Library, you will be asked to set a preview image. This opens a viewport where you can move and rotate your 3D model, to determine what image will be shown as a preview when browsing the Media Library, and in other locations in the CMS where an image of the 3D model is shown.

<img src="/img/cms/3d-preview.webp" alt="Display Rules" width="1050"/>

In this window, you can rotate and move your model either using the widget in the viewport. You can switch between moving and rotating using the "Rotate" or "Move" toggle in the upper right corner of the viewport. You can also adjust rotation by using the input fields on the right-hand side of the window, by entering a value between 0 and 360, corresponding to the number of degrees of rotation. Below these input fields are also buttons to reset all changes. Lastly, when changes have been made, you can choose to "Discard" or "Save" your changes in the popup in the bottom of the window.
