### Combo Box

<img src="/img/cms/combo-box.png" alt="A screenshot of the combo-box" width="378"/>

The combo-box provides the following features to the user:

* Filtering of solutions if multiple solutions are available.
* Searching through solutions by typing text in the input field.
* Content can be copied and pasted from/into the input field.

### Toolbar

<img src="/img/cms/Map_Toolbar.png" alt="A screenshot of map toolbar" width="300"/>

From left to right, the functionalities in the Toolbar are as follows (you can also hover over the icons in the CMS to see their names):

* **Add POI** - Creates a Point of Interest where you click on the Map. Afterwards it opens an editor where Location details can be adjusted.
* **Add Area** - Creates an Area by clicking on the Map to create corners of a polygon. Afterwards it opens an editor where Area details can be adjusted.
* **Show Network** - A toggle button to show or hide the Route Network your Directions feature will use.
* **Add Barrier Route Element** - Creates a Route Element on your map. The Barrier Route Element can be used to apply e.g. restrictions, delay, or define one way direction to specific parts of the Network. For example, if you do not want your directions to guide your visitors down a specific hallway, but there isn't a Door present, this Route Element can be used.
* **Reload Route Network** - Reloads the Route Network. Route Element changes' effect on the Network becomes visible after reloading the Network.
* **Zoom Level** - Adjust the Zoom Level. Values range from 15 (zoom out) to 22 (zoom in).

### Doors & Barriers

Doors and Barriers are Route Elements that allow you to manipulate certain portions of the Route Network. They appear if you click the **Show Network** button mentioned above.

**Doors** are Route Elements that indicates the presence of a door - or other entryway - in a building. Here is an example of doors editor that shows up after we choose a door placement on the map:

<img src="/img/cms/door_menu.png" alt="A screenshot of menu for adjusting doors" width="300"/>

* **Type** - Lets you define what type of Door this is. Each type has different defaults.
  * **Door** - A Door between two Rooms inside the same Building.
  * **ElevatorDoor** - A Door for an elevator, comes with a built-in Delay.
  * **ExternalDoor** - A type of Door that links to the outside Route Network, only connects to one Room.
  * **InterBuildingDoor** - A Door that connects between two Rooms in two different Buildings.
  * **Opening** - An entryway between two Rooms inside the same Building, but with no physical door.
  * **Hatchway** - A specific kind of Door that is used for smaller rooms in some specific situations.
* **Restrictions** - Set optional restrictions on who can use this Door.
  * **Open for all** - Open for all Users.
  * **Open for specific App User Roles** - Define certain App User Roles that can use this Door.
  * **Closed for all** - No Users can use this door.
* **Delay (seconds)** - Set a Delay in seconds for routes that pass through this door. Used in estimated arrival time calculations.
* **Radius (meters)** - Set the Radius in meters for this Door, to ensure it touches the Route Network.
* **Floor Index** - Use this to move a Door between two Floors.
* **One way direction (bearing)** - The exit angle of a one-way Door, in degrees, like a compass bearing. In the illustration below, the entered value would be 45, as the user would exit at a 45 degree bearing.

<img src="/img/cms/one_way_bearing_compass.png" alt="An illustration that demonstrates how to interpret bearing" width="300"/>

By default doors are snapping, meaning they are following the lines of current solution's geometry:

<img src="/img/cms/snapping-doors.png" alt="A screenshot of menu for adjusting doors"/>

While holding Shift keyboard button and moving mouse around doors:
* will snap to the middle point of the polygon that mouse is the closest to,
* will snap to the corners of the polygon that mouse is the closest to.


Different doors creation modes:
* **Single** - Creates single door on the map. Can be accessed by Add Door Route Element button in the toolbar:
<img src="/img/cms/single-door-icon.png" alt="An illustration that demonstrates how to interpret bearing"/>
* **Multiple with fixed width** - Creates multiple doors on the map with fixed width. Can be accessed by keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+D for **Windows**, Shift+Control+D for **IOS**.

<img src="/img/cms/multiple-fixed-width-doors-example.png" alt="A screenshot of menu for adjusting doors"/>

* **Multiple with custom width** - Creates multiple doors on the map with custom width. Can be accessed by keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+F for **Windows**, Shift+Control+F for **IOS**.

<img src="/img/cms/multiple-custom-width-doors-example.png" alt="A screenshot of menu for adjusting doors"/>

When accessing Multiple doors creation mode, there is an option to choose door type for all the doors that will be created.
We are also able to Undo latest door creation.

TEST

**NOTE:** This is the only property that we can change while creating doors. The rest of the properties have to be edited for each door individually.

<img src="/img/cms/multiple-doors-toolbar.png" alt="A screenshot of menu for adjusting doors"/>

**Barriers** are similar to Doors in the sense that they are used to modify the Route Network. Many of the settings and restrictions you can set are the same between the two kinds.

<img src="/img/cms/barrier_menu.png" alt="A screenshot of menu for adjusting barriers" width="300"/>

* **Restrictions** - Set optional restrictions on who can bypass this Barrier.
  * **Open for all** - Open for all Users.
  * **Open for specific App User Roles** - Define certain App User Roles that can bypass this Barrier.
  * **Closed for all** - No Users can bypass this Barrier.
* **Delay (seconds)** - Set a Delay in seconds for routes that pass through this Barrier. Used in estimated arrival time calculations.
* **Radius (meters)** - Set the Radius in meters for this Barrier, to ensure it touches the Route Network.
* **Floor Index** - Use this to move a Barrier between two Floors.
* **One way direction (bearing)** - The exit angle of a one-way Barrier, in degrees, like a compass bearing. In the illustration above, the entered value would be 45, as the user would exit at a 45 degree bearing.

## Solution Details

The API Keys used to make your MapsIndoors Solution consist of random combinations of letters and numbers. Here, you can assign them an Alias to make it easier to remember.

:::tip Alias

Do not set an Alias if you want to make it more difficult to find and load your MapsIndoors data. In that case, you should only load the data with an API key.

:::

<img src="/img/cms/Solution_Details_App_User_Roles.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the page overview of App User Roles" width="600"/>

You can also modify your App User Roles from within these pages.

#### API Keys

Here you manage the active API keys generated for your Solution. To load your MapsIndoors data in your apps, you need an API key.

You can create as many API keys as you want, and it is good practise to use one for each place you need to load data from MapsIndoors (each mobile platform, web app etc.).

You can easily delete an API key if it is unused, or has been compromised in some way.
