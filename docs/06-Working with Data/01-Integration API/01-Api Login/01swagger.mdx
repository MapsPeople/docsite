### Getting started using swagger

The Integration API can be access using our [swagger](https://cms.mapsindoors.com/doc) frontend. The first thing you want to do is to log in. This is done by pressing Authorize:

After this a confirmation window will be shown. Everything is already prefilled here, so just press Authorize and you will be lead to the mapsindoos Authorize service. Use your email and your password here to login.
