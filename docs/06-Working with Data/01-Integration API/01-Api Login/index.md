## Accessing your data with the Integration API

The MapsIndoors Integration API can be accessed in multiple ways and is intended for programatic used.
Sometimes it can be helpfull to make manual calls for debugging and learning the robes.

For this purpose a Swagger frontpage showing the different endpoints available and contains working examples for each endpoint using an example solution.
Furthermore it's possible to get started in thirdparty apps like Postman by using the openapi profile we provide as part of Swagger.
