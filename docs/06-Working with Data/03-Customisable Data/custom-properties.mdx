Custom Properties are key/value data that can be associated with any piece of geodata within MapsIndoors. MapsIndoors supports two different types of Customer Properties properties: 

 - Language dependent Custom Properties
 - Language indenpendet Custom Properties

Language dependent Custom Properties are ment for values that must be displayed to the end used in their preferred language. Using Language dependent Custom Properties it is possible to store a key/value combination in multiple different languages. The MapsIndoors SDKs allows for retrieval of the correct values based on the users preferred language. If your Solution has multiple languages, you must provide the necessary translations for each Custom Property in each of these languages.

Language indenpendet Custom Properties are ment for tagging data with key/value data that is relevant for the apps using the map data. These values will be available to the app regardless of the language of the end user and are often not directly displayed.  Examples of values that might be added as Language indenpendet Custom Properties could be:

 - Whether or not a room is bookable
 - The calendar id of a room used for booking
 - Ids of a location in other systems

If  a value is added to the same Key on both a Language independent Custom Property and Language dependent Custom Property, the Key-Value pair on the specific language overrides the generic Custom Property.

### Custom Property Templates
On Types it is possible to define Custom Property templates, which can ease getting consistent Custom Property Keys across multiple Locations. Keys added as Custom Property templates on a Type will be shown in the CMS on all Locations of that Type. This ensure that the key naming is consistent across all locations of that type. Adding values to the keys results in key/value pairs being available trough the SDK.

## Creating Custom Properties

Custom Properties are created for each Location, defined using a `key` and a `value`. This is found in a section in the menu for each Location. When adding a Language dependent Custom Property through the CMS, a value input field will be provided for each language in your Solution allowing you to input the translated values directly in the CMS.

You can add Custom Properties through the Integration API with the exact same requirements and options as when adding them via the MapsIndoors CMS.

## Reading Custom Properties

The method for reading and using these custom properties depends on which platform you're developing for. Here are some examples:

Using the above screenshot as an example basis you fetch the entire custom property using the following code:

<Tabs groupId="data-custom-properties">
<TabItem value="android" label="Android v4" default>

```java
String email = (String) location.getProperty("email");
```

When retrieving custom properties, they are always returned as a String.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ios-v4" label="iOS v4">

```swift
let data = location.property(key: "email")
```

To retrieve individual segments of the property, you can use:

```swift
let text = data.text
let value = data.value
let type = data.type
```

* `let text = data.text` retrieves the content of the `key` field, and in the given example, would return `email`.
* `let value = data.value` retrieves the content of the `value` field, and in the given example, would return `123@email.com`.
* `let type = data.type` retrieves the type of the Custom Property, and will in most known cases return `text`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ios-v3" label="iOS v3">

```swift
let data = location.getField(forKey: "email")
```

To retrieve individual segments of the property, you can use:

```swift
let text = data.text
let value = data.value
let type = data.type
```

* `let text = data.text` retrieves the content of the `key` field, and in the given example, would return `email`.
* `let value = data.value` retrieves the content of the `value` field, and in the given example, would return `123@email.com`.
* `let type = data.type` retrieves the type of the Custom Property, and will in most known cases return `text`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="web" label="Web v4">

```js
let data = location.getFieldForKey('email')
```

To retrieve individual segments of the property, you can use:

```js
let text = data.text
let value = data.value
let type = data.type
```

* `data.text` retrieves the content of the `key` field, and in the given example, would return `email`.
* `data.value` retrieves the content of the `value` field, and in the given example, would return `123@email.com`.
* `data.type` retrieves the type of the Custom Property, and will in most known cases return `text`.

### Example 1

You are a conference organizer that needs to associate some pieces of data with each exhibitor, like the sponsor level they are are on and what the size of their stand should be. You would create two Language independet Custom Properties, one called `sponsorLevel` and another called `standSize`. When building your app on top of our SDK, you could use these Custom Properties to assign a gold color to your highest paying sponsors' names, and a larger image because of their larger stand size.

### Example 2

You are a museum operator providing a digital map of your venue. Your digital map presents points of interest for the various exhibits and you would like to associate both a text description of the item exhibited as well as a link to a video of an expert giving additional insight about the item. To accomplish this you create a Language dependent Custom Property called `itemDescription` and provide a description for each language your Solution supports. You choose a Language dependent Custom Property for this purpose as the values is to be displayed to the end user and you need the user to be given description in their preferred language.
In addition to this you create a Language independent Custom Property called `videoLink` to store the link to the explanation video. As this is a Language independent Custom Property it will be available to the app regardless of the users preferred language.
