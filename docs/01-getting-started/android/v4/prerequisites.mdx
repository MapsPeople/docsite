MapsIndoors is built on top of Google Maps or Mapbox depending on the SDK flavor you decide to use. On this page, you'll create the necessary keys with the relevant APIs enabled, retrieve a MapsIndoors API key and install the necessary dependencies to get started building your own app.

## Get Your Google Maps API key

First, you need to [setup at a new project in the Google Cloud Console](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started) (**Please note:** You are going to need a Google Billing Account for this step, so go ahead and [create one](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account#create_a_new_billing_account) if you haven't already). When the project is created, the following APIs and the specific SDK you plan to use must be enabled from the [Maps API Library Page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library?filter=category:maps).

* Google Maps Distance Matrix API
* Google Maps Directions API
* Google Places API Web Service
* Maps SDK for Android/iOS - if you're developing an app for Android/iOS respectively **_OR_** Maps JavaScript API if you're developing a web application.

When the above 3 APIs and the relevant SDK are enabled, you can retrieve the API key from the [Credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/apiui/credential). On the Credentials page, click _Create credentials_ > _API key_.

## Get your Mapbox Access Token

When using Mapbox you need a Mapbox account and configure credentials to run a Mapbox map with MapsIndoors and downloading the SDK: [Installation](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/maps/guides/install/)

Once this is setup for the project, you can use the MapsIndoors Mapbox flavor.

## Get Your MapsIndoors API key

If you are not a customer yet, you can use this demo MapsIndoors API key `d876ff0e60bb430b8fabb145` to follow this guide, or you can [contact MapsPeople](https://resources.mapspeople.com/contact-us) to get your building drawings processed and hosted by us to receive a unique API key. For the purpose of this guide, both methods will work.
