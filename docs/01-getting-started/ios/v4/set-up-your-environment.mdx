Now that you have taken care of all the preliminary issues, we can start building the app. Throughout this guide, you will continously modify this project to extend its functionality to cover a number of basic features.

:::danger Known iOS issues

1. Due to [a bug in CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/7155) it is necessary to include the `post_install` hook in your Podfile described in the [PodFile post_install](https://github.com/MapsIndoors/MapsIndoorsIOS/wiki/Podfile-post_install-v4) wiki.

:::

## Create an Xcode Project

We recommend using [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for following along, for this guide we will be using Xcode 14.2. Note that an iOS mobile device is not required, as Xcode allows the use of a simulator. Furthermore, in accordance with the known issues with Google Maps and Arm-based Apple Silicon (M1) Macs, we will be using an iPhone 11 (iOS 13.7) simulator throughout.

We start off by creating an Xcode project using the App template,

<img src="/img/getting-started/ios-xcode_template.png" alt="A screenshot of the Xcode template" width="600"/>

For the project settings, you can call it anything you like, however ensure the following settings are set to follow along easier,

* Interface: Storyboard
* Language: Swift

<img src="/img/getting-started/ios-xcode-project_options.png" alt="A screenshot of the Xcode Project Options" width="600"/>

You should now have a project folder with the following files,

<img src="/img/getting-started/ios-xcode-project_folder.png" alt="A screenshot of the Xcode Project Folder" width="300"/>

For the sake of simplicity we will only be operating on these pre-generated files throughout the guide.

## Installing the MapsIndoors SDK

MapsIndoors can either be installed using CocoaPods ([Getting Started with CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)) or through a manual installation.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cocoapods" label="Cocoapods" default>

### Installing MapsIndoors Using CocoaPods

From MapsIndoors SDK version 4.0.0 and up, in order for CocoaPods to fetch the SDK properly it is neccessary to install `git-lfs` ([Install Guide](https://git-lfs.github.com/)).

1. Create an empty text file named `Podfile` in your project directory (same folder as your *.xcodeproj*).
2. Add your dependecies to the Podfile as followed (replace `YOUR_APPLICATION_TARGET_NAME_HERE` with your project name),

    ```text
    source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

    platform :ios, '15.0' # Replace 15.0 with you iOS Minimum Deployment Target

    target 'YOUR_APPLICATION_TARGET_NAME_HERE' do
      use_frameworks!

      pod 'MapsIndoors', '~>4.0'
    end
    ```

:::caution

In the line containing `pod 'MapsIndoors', '~>4.0'`, where it currently says `4.0`, be sure to replace this number with whatever the latest version of the iOS SDK is.

:::

3. Save the Podfile and open a terminal in the directory of the project.
`cd \<path-to-project>`

4. Run `pod install` in the terminal.

5. Close Xcode.

6. From this time onwards, use the *.xcworkspace* file to open the project from now on.

### Install MapsIndoors Manually

In order for MapsIndoors to be operational, the Google Maps SDK must also be installed since MapsIndoors rely on it:

* [Google Maps iOS SDK](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/overview): [manual install](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/start#install-manually). You should use [Google Maps iOS version 7.4.0](https://dl.google.com/geosdk/12cdf90d54d85bfcc90d340148d86362ee3189ea24b4bd20ca891e9bd33ded21/GoogleMaps-7.4.0.tar.gz) since MapsIndoors >= 4.0.0 is linked against this version.

When the Google Maps SDK dependency is installed, go through these steps to install MapsIndoors:

* Download and unzip the latest [MapsIndoors.xcframework](https://github.com/MapsIndoors/MapsIndoorsIOS/releases/download/3.43.1/MapsIndoors.xcframework.zip).
* Drag and drop the framework into your XCode project. In the dialog that pops up, choose “Copy items if needed” and make sure the framework is added to the correct target.

:::tip Moving on

This "Getting Started" guide is created using a specific version of the SDK. When moving beyond the "Getting Started" guide, please be sure to use the latest version of the SDK.

## Adding API Credentials

Open back up the project and navigate to the file `AppDelegate.swift`.

1. Add the following import statements to the top of the file,  

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="googlemaps" label="GoogleMaps" default>

      ```swift
      import GoogleMaps  
      import MapsIndoorsCore
      ```
      
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="mapbox" label="Mapbox">

      ```swift
      import Mapbox  
      import MapsIndoorsCore
      ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. Insert the following into the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method. If you are using `Mapbox` then provide your API Key when you add your map to the view inside `viewDidLoad()` in your `ViewController.swift`

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="googlemaps" label="GoogleMaps" default>

      ```swift
       GMSServices.provideAPIKey(`YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY`)
      ```
      
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="mapbox" label="Mapbox">

      ```swift
       ResourceOptions(accessToken: `YOUR_MAPBOX_API_KEY`)
       let initOptions = MapInitOptions(resourceOptions: myResourceOptions, styleURI: StyleURI.light)
            self.mapView = MapView(frame: view.bounds, mapInitOptions: initOptions)
            // set the MPMapConfig
            MPMapConfig(mapBoxView: mapView!, accessToken: "---")
            Task {
            await MPMapsIndoors.shared.load(apiKey:`YOUR_MAPSINDOORS_API_KEY`)
        }
      ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

Finally, remember to replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `YOUR_MAPBOX_API_KEY` with your Google API key and `YOUR_MAPSINDOORS_API_KEY` with your MapsIndoors API demo key `d876ff0e60bb430b8fabb145`.
