This guide is made based off a basic application already made, to keep most of the code specific to the MapsIndoors SDK. So that we don't need to spend too much time modifying or implementing UI elements.
If confident, you can start off by creating your own project, and just taking the context of the different steps of the getting started guide. A short setup of a React native application with MapsIndoors is described below.
## Set Up Your Environment

Read here how to set up your **[React Native development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)**

## Basic Example

You can find the basic example to start from here: [INSERT GITHUB LINK HERE](IAMABASICIMPLGITHUBLINK)
Follow the included README on how to get the project up and running.

## Setup MapsIndoors

To run MapsIndoors you need to insert a google API key inside your project.

<Tabs groupId="getting-started-react-native-project-setup">
<TabItem value="Android" label="Android" default>

Inside the project navigate to `android/app/src/main/res/values/google_maps_api.xml` and replace the `INSERT_KEY_HERE` with your google API key

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="iOS" label="iOS">

Inside the project navigate to `ios/GettingStartedProject/AppDelegate.mm` and replace the `/*Your Google API key here*/` inside `provideAPIKey` with your Google API key

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## RN setup

### Project creation

Create a new React Native project by running the following command

```bash
npx react-native@latest init GettingStartedProject
```

### Dependencies

Start by installing the bindings for your preferred map provider. There is currently only support for using one of these packages at a time.
```bash
npm install @mapsindoors/react-native-maps-indoors-google-maps
# npm install @mapsindoors/react-native-maps-indoors-mapbox
```


The getting started project makes use of the following publicly available UI components. We recommend using them while following the getting started guide.

```bash
# Bottomsheet
npm install @gorholm/bottom-sheet@^4

# Navigation
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context

#"react-native-pager-view"
```

The above components make use of the following dependecies, which take a few extra steps to install.
```bash
# Dependencies
npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler
```
Please see the following links for additional steps needed for installing the dependencies:<br/>
https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/installation/ <br/>
https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/installation/

### Pod install

After making changes to dependecies, especially those involving native code, you will need to run the following command from the ios folder of your project:

```bash
pod install
```

Alternatively you can install the npm package `pod-install` and then run the following command from anywhere within the project:

```bash
npx pod-install
```

### Folder structure

To better seperate the typescript code from the other configuration related files, we move `App.tsx` into a new folder called `src/`. In order for the App to recognize this, we make the following change to `index.js`:

```diff
- import App from './App';
+ import App from './src/App';
```
