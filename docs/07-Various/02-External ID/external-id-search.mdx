A method on MapsIndoors is available to retrieve locations by their externalId. This is only for exact matches and is not a part of the general search implementations, so must be specifically implemented.

The function on all 3 platforms functions similarly, returning an Array or List of Locations that match the supplied External ID strings.

<Tabs groupId="various-external-id-search">
<TabItem value="android" label="Android" default>

Running the below snippet will return a List of `MPLocations`.

```java
val locations = MapsIndoors.getLocationsByExternalIds(externalIds)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS">

:::danger Known iOS Issues

1. Developing on the new Arm-based Apple Silicon (M1) Macs requires building and running on a physical iOS device or using an iOS simulator running iOS 13.7, e.g. iPhone 11. This is a temporary limitation in Google Maps SDK for iOS, and as such also a limitation in MapsIndoors, due to the dependency to Google Maps.
1. Note: Due to [a bug in CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/7155) it is necessary to include the `post_install` hook in your Podfile described in the [PodFile post_install](https://github.com/MapsIndoors/MapsIndoorsIOS/wiki/Podfile-post_install) wiki.
