The print map tool is found in the Standard Web App and can be used for different purposes, e.g. to print evacuation routes for each Floor at your Venue.

The print preview can be triggered by the print button in the top right corner of the map view in the Standard Web App, or by one of the following shortcuts:

* CMD + P (macOS)
* CTRL + P (Windows)

Clicking the button, or hitting the keyboard combination, triggers a full screen map print preview as seen here:
