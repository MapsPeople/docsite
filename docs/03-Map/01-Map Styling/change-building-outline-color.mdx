One way you can alter the look and feel of your map is by changing the color of the outline surrounding your buildings.

The method to do this is different for each platform.

<Tabs groupId="display-rules">
<TabItem value="cms" label="CMS" default>

In the CMS, you can edit the Building Outline Display Rules by navigating to `Solution Details` -> `Solution Settings` -> `Building Highlight`. Here you will find the "Polygon" section that contains options related to the appearance of the Building Outline. You see your setting by navigating to `Map`.

1. **Visibility** - Controls whether the Building Outline is visible on the map.
    * The system will accept a Boolean here, so either `true` or `false`.
1. **Zoom from** - Sets the minimum Zoom Level at which the Building Outline is visible.
    * The value should be a number between 1 and 25, with 1 being very far away, and 25 being very close (25 not available for all Solutions). In a general use case, most users will only need values between 15 and 25.
    * If you are developing using the JavaScript SDK for Google Maps, the value must be an integer. If you are developing for Android or iOS, or using a different map provider, the value may be fractional.
1. **Zoom to** - Sets the maximum Zoom Level at which the Building Outline is visible.
    * The value should be a number between 1 and 25, with 1 being very far away, and 25 being very close (25 not available for all Solutions). In a general use case, most users will only need values between 15 and 25.
    * Checking the `Max zoom` checkbox will ensure that the Building Outline will be visible at the largest possible Zoom level (this value may increase in the future).
    * If you are developing using the JavaScript SDK for Google Maps, the value must be an integer. If you are developing for Android or iOS, or using a different map provider, the value may be fractional.
1. **Stroke color** - Controls the stroke color of the Building Outline.
    * In the CMS, you can select a color using the color picker displayed when clicking the color input field.
    * If setting the color in-app, the value provided must be in 6-digit HEX code (eg. #3071D9).
1. **Stroke width** - Controls the stroke width (in pixels) of the Building Outline.
1. **Stroke opacity** - Controls the stroke opacity of the Building Outline.
    * The value here should be between 0 and 1, for example a value of 1 gives 100% opacity, 0.2 gives 20% opacity, etc.

If you are looking for documentation on Android SDK v3, please [see here](https://docs-legacy.mapsindoors.com/content/legacy/android_v3/).

To change the building outline color, along with other display properties, you must get and modify the Building Outline Display Rule.

Note that the DisplayRule will be null if MapsIndoors is not loaded.

```java
MapsIndoors.getDisplayRule(MPSolutionDisplayRule.BUILDING_OUTLINE).setPolygonStrokeColor(Color.BLUE);
```

The parameter `strokeColor` takes the color in ARGB format (with an alpha-channel value), the syntax being `AARRGGBB`.

Note that only the polygon stroke color, width, opacity, visible, zoomFrom and zoomTo values are respected.

<TabItem value="ios-v4" label="iOS v4">

To change the building outline color, along with other display properties, you must get and modify the Building Outline Display Rule.

```swift
let buildingOutline = MPMapsIndoors.shared.displayRuleFor(displayRuleType: .buildingOutline)
buildingOutline?.polygonStrokeColor = .blue
```
Note that only the polygon stroke color, width, opacity, visible, zoomFrom and zoomTo values are respected.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ios-v3" label="iOS v3">

To change the building outline, use the properties of `MapControl.locationHighlightDisplayRule`.

```swift
myMapControl.locationHighlightDisplayRule?.highlightOutlineColor = UIColor.red
```

The sample uses the example `UIColor.red`, but this can be any standard color such as `UIColor.green` or `UIColor.lightGray`. You can also define RGB values as follows: `UIColor(red: 123, blue: 36, green: 273, alpha: 100)`.

The building outline design will be taken from the values set through the CMS. To change the building outline you can use the different properties of the `BuildingOutlineOptions` interface. The properties are the following:

1. `visible` - Controls whether the Building Outline is visible on the map.
    * The value should be a Boolean here, so either `true` or `false`.
1. `zoomFrom` - Sets the minimum Zoom Level at which the Building Outline is visible.
    * The value should be a number between 1 and 25, with 1 being very far away, and 25 being very close (25 not available for all Solutions). In a general use case, most users will only need values between 15 and 25.
1. `zoomTo`- Sets the maximum Zoom Level at which the Building Outline is visible.
    * The value should be a number between 1 and 25, with 1 being very far away, and 25 being very close (25 not available for all Solutions). In a general use case, most users will only need values between 15 and 25.
1. `strokeColor` - Controls the stroke color of the Building Outline.
    * This property accepts any color as defined by conventional CSS color values. See [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) for more information on CSS color values.
1. `strokeWeight` - Controls the stroke width (in pixels) of the Building Outline.
    * The value should be a number between.
1. `strokeOpacity` - Controls the stroke opacity of the Building Outline.
    * The value should be a number between 0 and 1, for example a value of 1 gives 100% opacity, 0.2 gives 20% opacity, etc.

To read more about the `BuildingOutlineOptions` interface see the [reference docs](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/js/sdk/latest/docs/BuildingOutlineOptions.html).

One way to do this in practice, call `setBuildingOutlineOptions` on the MapsIndoors instance, to change the appearance of the building outline.

```javascript
mapsIndoors.setBuildingOutlineOptions({
    visible: true,
    zoomFrom: 15,
    zoomTo: 20,
    strokeColor: '#fcd305',
    strokeWeight: 5,
    strokeOpacity: 0.8
});
```

Alternatively, you can define the `buildingOutlineOptions` property when creating a new mapsindoors instance.

```javascript
new mapsindoors.MapsIndoors({
    mapView: mapView,
    buildingOutlineOptions: {
        visible: true,
        zoomFrom: 15,
        zoomTo: 20,
        strokeColor: '#fcd305',
        strokeWeight: 5,
        strokeOpacity: 0.8
    }
});
```
