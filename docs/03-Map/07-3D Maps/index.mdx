Starting with the V4 versions of our SDK's, MapsIndoors has introduced the functionality to have your map viewed in 3D, with the appropriate navigational features, rather than just a flat 2D image.

## Requirements

Regardless of your app platform, you need to use the **Mapbox** map provider in order to use this functionality. You also need to be using V4 of our MapsIndoors SDK's, the specific minimum version depending on the platform.

* Android SDK v4.X.X
* iOS SDK v4.X.X
* Web SDK v4.X.X

If you fulfill the above requirements, you can contact your MapsPeople representative to have the 3D map functionality enabled for your Solution(s).

## Best Practices

While exact best practices will depend on your specific solution and implementation, we can provide some general pointers of things to consider when developing your solution to work with MapsIndoors 3D maps. Most of these will be specifically pertaining to the inclusion of 3D models in your solution, not to utilising 3D walls and 3D room extrusions. 

* Keep your models as low-poly as possible.
* Consider whether all your locations need a 3D model.
* Where possible, consider reusing the same model, instead of uploading 3 different models with only minor variations.
