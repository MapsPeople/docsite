User interactions on the map, whether it is a Google Map or a Mapbox Map, are communicated from MapsIndoors via the [`MPMapControlDelegate`](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/reference/ios/4.1.3/documentation/mapsindoors/mpmapcontroldelegate).
The delegate will also inform about changes to the current floor, the selected location, building and venue, as well as camera related events.

Visit the reference docs for [`MPMapControlDelegate`](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/reference/ios/4.1.3/documentation/mapsindoors/mpmapcontroldelegate) to see all available events. Generally, if you return `true` from the delegate methods it means that you do no want the default MapsIndoors behaviour to happen. This makes it possible for you to change the behaviour to your exact needs. If you return `false`, MapsIndoors will provide a default behaviour for the event.

## Examples

You can set the `delegate` of `MPMapControl` to a class you create to listen to some or all events from the MapControl.

```swift
myMapControl.delegate = self
```

### Building Changed Event

The [`didChange(selectedBuilding:)`](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/reference/ios/4.1.3/documentation/mapsindoors/mpmapcontroldelegate/didchange(selectedbuilding:)) event will be fired when the map is moved around and a new Building comes in focus.

This is also related to the Floor Selector, which will update its view to show the Floors of the current Building.

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, MPMapControlDelegate {
    func didChange(selectedBuilding: MPBuilding?) -> Bool {
        print("Building changed: \(selectedBuilding.name)")
        return false
    }
}
```

### Floor Changed Event

The [`didChange(floorIndex:)`](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/reference/ios/4.1.3/documentation/mapsindoors/mpmapcontroldelegate/didchange(floorindex:)) event will be fired when the Floor is changed; either by clicking the Floor Selector or by calling e.g. `select(floorIndex:)` on the MapsIndoors instance.

The event handler is called with the Floor Index of the current Floor.

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, MPMapControlDelegate {
    func didChange(floorIndex: Int) -> Bool {
        print("Floor index changed: \(floorIndex)")
        return false
    }
}
```

### Tap/Click Event

The [`didTapIcon(location:)`](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/reference/ios/4.1.3/documentation/mapsindoors/mpmapcontroldelegate/didtapicon(location:)) event will fire when the user taps on a Location on the map.

The event handler is called with a [MPLocation](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/reference/ios/4.1.3/documentation/mapsindoors/mplocation) object representing the Location clicked.

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, MPMapControlDelegate {
    func didTapIcon(location: MPLocation) -> Bool {
        print("Location tapped: \(location.name)")
        return false
    }
}
```

## Getting Marker from Location

If a `MPLocation` has been displayed on a map, the marker can be retrieved using `location.marker`. On the opposite, get a `MPLocation` from a `GMSMarker` using `getLocation(marker: GMSMarker)` on `MPMapControl`:

```swift
myMapControl.getLocation(marker : GMSMarker!)
```

## Handling Marker Selections

Detecting the user tapping a marker or an infowindow is part of the Google Maps SDK for iOS. Assign `myGMSMapView.delegate` and implementing the methods: `mapView.didTapMarker(marker: GMSMarker)` and `mapView.didTapInfoWindowOfMarker(marker: GMSMarker)`

```swift
func mapView(_ mapView: GMSMapView, didTap marker: GMSMarker) -> Bool {
    let location = mapControl?.getLocation(marker)
    if location != nil {
        myTextLabel.text = location!.name
    }
    return false
}

func mapView(_ mapView: GMSMapView, didTapInfoWindowOf marker: GMSMarker) -> Bool {
    let location = mapControl?.getLocation(marker)
    if location != nil {
        myTextLabel.text = location!.name
    }
    return false
}
```

## MapControl Delegate
The MapControl delegate can inform you when the various data from the MapsIndoors services are loaded through it's `MPMapControlDelegate` so you should set the delegate, in most of the cases with the current UIViewController:

```swift
myMapControl.delegate = self
```

Implement the `onMapDataReady` method :

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, MPMapControlDelegate
```

Then implementing the methods below :

```swift
func onMapDataReady(){

}
```

## Overview

In this, we will take a look at the events that MapsIndoors offers and how to utilize them.

> Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so you can respond to them in some way if desired.
>-- <cite>[MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events)</cite>

For example, if the user clicks on a Location on the map, then you can react to that action by presenting the user with additional info about the Location.

A code example is shown in the JSFiddle below, but will be run through bit by bit in this guide.

<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/mapspeople/gex62wzn/embed/html,result/"></script>

### Ready Event

The `ready` event will be fired when MapsIndoors is done initializing and is ready to interact.

```javascript
mapsIndoors.addListener('ready', (e) => {
 log(`MapsIndoors: Ready`);
});
```

### Building Changed Event

The `building_changed` event will be fired when the map is moved around and a new Building comes in focus.

This is also related to the Floor Selector, which will update its view to show the Floors of the current Building.

The event handler is called with a [building](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/js/sdk/latest/docs/global.html#Building) object representing the building in focus.

```javascript
mapsIndoors.addListener('building_changed', (e) => {
 log(`Building changed: ${e.buildingInfo.name}`);
});
```

### Floor Changed Event

The `floor_changed` event will be fired when the Floor is changed; either by clicking the Floor Selector or by calling `setFloor()` on the MapsIndoors instance.

The event handler is called with the Floor Index of the current Floor.

```javascript
mapsIndoors.addListener('floor_changed', (e) => {
 log(`Floor changed: ${e}`);
});
```

### Click Event

The `click` event will fire when the user clicks on a Location on the map.

The event handler is called with a [location](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/js/sdk/latest/docs/global.html#Location) object representing the Location clicked.

```javascript
mapsIndoors.addListener('click', (location) => {
 log(`Clicked: ${location.properties.name}`);
});
```
