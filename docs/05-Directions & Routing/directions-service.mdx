The class `MPDirectionsService` is used to request routes from one point to another. The minimum required input to receive a route is an `origin` and a `destination`.
This example shows how to setup and execute a query for a Route:

```java
MPDirectionsService directionsService = new MPDirectionsService(mContext);
MPDirectionsRenderer directionsRenderer = new MPDirectionsRenderer(mMapControl);
MPPoint origin = new MPPoint(57.057917, 9.950361, 0.0);
MPPoint destination = new MPPoint(57.058038, 9.950509, 0.0);
directionsService.setRouteResultListener((route, error) -> {
});
directionsService.query(origin, destination);
```

## Change Transportation Mode

In MapsIndoors, the transportation mode is referred to as **travel mode**. There are four travel modes, **walking**, **bicycling**, **driving** and **transit** (public transportation). The travel modes generally applies for outdoor navigation. Indoor navigation calculations are based on **walking** travel mode.

Set the **travel mode** on your request using the `setTravelMode` method on `MPDirectionsService`:

```java
void createRoute(MPLocation mpLocation) {
    //If MPDirectionsService has not been instantiated create it here and assign the results call back to the activity.
    if (mpDirectionsService == null) {
        mpDirectionsService = new MPDirectionsService(mContext);
        mpDirectionsService.setRouteResultListener(this::onRouteResult);
    }
    mpDirectionsService.setTravelMode(MPTravelMode.WALKING);
      //Queries the MPDirectionsService for a route with the hardcoded user location and the point from a location.
    mpDirectionsService.query(mUserLocation, mpLocation.getPoint());
}
```

The travel modes generally only apply for outdoor navigation. Indoor navigation calculations are based on the **walking** travel mode.

## Route Restrictions

### Avoiding Stairs and Steps

For wheelchair users or other users with limited mobility, it may be relevant to request a Route that avoids stairs and steps. Avoid certain **way types** on the route using the `addRouteRestriction` method on `MPDirectionsService`.

```java
void getRoute() {
  MPDirectionsService directionsService = new MPDirectionsService(mContext);
  MPDirectionsRenderer directionsRenderer = new MPDirectionsRenderer(mMapControl);
  MPPoint origin = new MPPoint(57.057917, 9.950361, 0.0);
  MPPoint destination = new MPPoint(57.058038, 9.950509, 0.0);
  directionsService.addAvoidWayType(MPHighway.STEPS);
  directionsService.addAvoidWayType(MPHighway.ELEVATOR);
  directionsService.setRouteResultListener((route, error) -> {
  });
  directionsService.query(origin, destination);
}
```

When Route restrictions are set on the `MPDirectionsService` they will be applied to any subsequent queries as well. You can remove them again by calling `clearRouteRestrictions`.

```java
void clearRouteRestrictions() {
  mpDirectionsService.clearRouteRestrictions();
}
```

### App User Role Restrictions

In the MapsIndoors CMS it is possible to restrict certain **ways** in the Route Network to only be accessible by users belonging to certain Roles.

You can get the available Roles with help of the `MapsIndoors.getAppliedUserRoles`:

```java
List<MPUserRole> getUserRoles() {
  return MapsIndoors.getAppliedUserRoles();
}
```

User Roles can be set on a global level using `MapsIndoors.applyUserRoles`.

```java
void setUserRoles(List<MPUserRole> userRoles) {
    MapsIndoors.applyUserRoles(userRoles);
}
```

This will affect all following Directions requests as well as search queries with `MapsIndoors`.

For more information about App User Roles, see [this documentation](/app-user-roles/).

## Transit Departure and Arrival Time

When using the Transit travel mode, you must set a **departure date** or an **arrival date** on the route using the `setTime` method on `MPDirectionsService` and declaring if it is a departure or not through `setIsDeparture`. The `date` parameter is the epoch time, in seconds, as an integer, and it is only possible to use one of these properties at a time.

```java
void setDepartureTime(Date date) {
    mpDirectionsService.setIsDeparture(true);
    mpDirectionsService.setTime(date);
}
void setArrivalTime(Date date) {
    mpDirectionsService.setIsDeparture(false);
    mpDirectionsService.setTime(date);
}
```

<TabItem value="ios-v3" label="iOS v3">

The class `MPDirectionsService` is used to request routes from one point to another. The minimal required input is an `origin` and a `destination`. You need to build a query using the `MPDirectionsQuery` class.

This example shows how to setup and execute a query for a Route:

```swift
let directions = MPDirectionsService.init()
let origin = MPPoint.init(lat: 57.057917, lon: 9.950361, zValue:0)!
let destination = MPPoint.init(lat: 57.058038, lon: 9.950509, zValue:0)!
let directionsQuery = MPDirectionsQuery.init(originPoint: origin, destination: destination)

directions.routing(with: directionsQuery) { (route, error) in

}
```

## Change Transportation Mode

In MapsIndoors, the transportation mode is referred to as **travel mode**. There are four travel modes, **walking**, **bicycling**, **driving** and **transit** (public transportation). The travel modes generally applies for outdoor navigation. Indoor navigation calculations are based on **walking** travel mode.

Set **travel mode** on your request using the `travelMode` property on `MPDirectionsQuery`:

```swift
let directionsQuery = MPDirectionsQuery.init(originPoint: origin!, destination: destination!)
directionsQuery.travelMode = .driving
```

The travel modes generally applies for outdoor navigation. Indoor navigation calculations are based on **walking** travel mode.

## Route Restrictions

### Avoiding Stairs and Steps

For a wheelchair user or a user with physical disabilities it may be relevant to request a Route that avoids stairs and steps. Avoid certain **way types** on the route using the `avoidWayTypes` property.

```swift
let directionsQuery = MPDirectionsQuery.init(originPoint: origin, destination: destination)
directionsQuery.avoidWayTypes = ["stairs"]
```

### App User Role Restrictions

In the MapsIndoors CMS it is possible to restrict certain ways in the Route Network to be used by users of certain Roles.

It is possible to get the available Roles with help of the `MPSolutionProvider`:

```swift
MPSolutionProvider.init().getUserRoles { (userRoles, error) in
    let myUserRole = myUserRole.first
}
```

User Roles can be set on a global level using `MapsIndoors.userRoles`.

```swift
MapsIndoors.userRoles = [myUserRole]
```

This will affect all following Directions requests as well as search queries with `MPLocationService`. User Roles can also be set for a single Directions request.

```swift
let directionsQuery = MPDirectionsQuery.init(originPoint: origin, destination: destination)
directionsQuery.userRoles = [myUserRole]

directionsService.routing(with: directionsQuery) { (route, error) in

}
```

User Role restrictions set for a specific Directions Query will take precedence over User Roles set on a global level.

## Transit Departure and Arrival Time

Set a **departure date** or an **arrival date** on the route using the `departure` or `arrival` property. This is relevant when using the Transit travel mode. It will only make sense to set one of these properties at a time.

```swift
let directionsQuery = MPDirectionsQuery.init(originPoint: origin, destination: destination)
directionsQuery.departure = Date.init()
```

In the MapsIndoors CMS it is possible to restrict certain ways in the Route Network to be used by users of certain Roles.

It is possible to get the available Roles with help of the `SolutionsService`:

```js
mapsindoors.services.SolutionsService.getUserRoles().then(userRoles => {
  console.log(userRoles);
});
```

> For more information, see the [reference documentation](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/js/sdk/latest/docs/mapsindoors.services.SolutionsService.html#getUserRoles).

User Roles can be set on a global level using `mapsindoors.MapsIndoors.setUserRoles()`.

```js

```

> For more information, see the [reference documentation](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/js/sdk/latest/docs/mapsindoors.MapsIndoors.html#.setUserRoles).

This will affect all following Directions requests as well as search queries with `LocationsService`.

## Transit Departure and Arrival Time

Set a **departure date** or an **arrival date** on the route using the `transitOptions` property. It will only make sense to set one of these properties at a time.

```js
