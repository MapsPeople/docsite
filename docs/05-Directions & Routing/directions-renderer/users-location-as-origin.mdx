Often you may want to get directions starting from a user's actual current position, instead of from another fixed Location. The following code snippet gives an example on how to implement this.

To query for a route, create a `MPPoint` from the Latitude, longitude and the z-index of the user, and use that on the `DirectionsService.query` function, like this:

```kotlin
val directionsService = MPDirectionsService(mContext)
//Create an Origin MPPoint with the users latitude, longitude and Z-index. If no Z-index is available just use 0.0
val origin = MPPoint(userLatitude, userLongitude, userZIndex)
val destination = destinationLocation.getPoint()
directionsService.setRouteResultListener { route, error ->
  //Handle the route result here
}
directionsService.query(origin, destination)
```

`userLatitude`, `userLongitude`. `userZIndex` and `destinationLocation` are all placeholder variable names where you insert your data.

Further details on how user positioning works, and how to display it, can be found [here](map/positioning/blue-dot/).

This results in directions queries originating from the user's current location.

Often you may want to get directions starting from a user's actual current location, instead of from another fixed Location. The following code snippet gives an example on how to implement this.

First, [initialize a `PositionProvider`](map/positioning/blue-dot/), which can be used with `MPDirectionsQuery` to achieve the desired result.

In order to use the `PositionProvider` to extract a `MPPoint`, you need to use `MapsIndoors.latestPositionResult.geometry`. This returns an `MPPoint`. which will serve as the origin point for the directions query. This `MPPoint` is then given to the method `MPDirectionsQuery initWithOriginPoint:destination:`.

```swift
let userPosition = MapsIndoors.positionProvider?.latestPositionResult?.geometry
let destination = MPPoint.init(lat: 57.058038, lon: 9.950509, zValue:0)!
if let origin = userPosition {
    let directionsQuery = MPDirectionsQuery.init(originPoint: origin, destination: destination)
    directions.routing(with: directionsQuery) { (route, error) in
    }
}
```

This results in directions queries originating from the user's current location.
