Often you may want to get directions starting from a user's actual current position, instead of from another fixed Location. The following code snippet gives an example on how to implement this.

To query for a route, create a `MPPoint` from the Latitude, longitude and the z-index of the user, and use that on the `DirectionsService.query` function, like this:

```kotlin
val directionsService = MPDirectionsService(mContext)
//Create an Origin MPPoint with the users latitude, longitude and Z-index. If no Z-index is available just use 0.0
val origin = MPPoint(userLatitude, userLongitude, userZIndex)
val destination = destinationLocation.getPoint()
directionsService.setRouteResultListener { route, error ->
  //Handle the route result here
}
directionsService.query(origin, destination)
```

`userLatitude`, `userLongitude`. `userZIndex` and `destinationLocation` are all placeholder variable names where you insert your data.

This results in directions queries originating from the user's current location.

Often you may want to get directions starting from a user's actual current location, instead of from another fixed Location. The following code snippet gives an example on how to implement this.

First, [initialize a `PositionProvider`](/blue-dot/), which can be used with `MPDirectionsQuery` to achieve the desired result.

In order to use the `PositionProvider` to extract a `MPPoint`, you need to use `MapsIndoors.latestPositionResult.geometry`. This returns an `MPPoint`. which will serve as the origin point for the directions query. This `MPPoint` is then given to the method `MPDirectionsQuery initWithOriginPoint:destination:`.

```swift
let userPosition = MapsIndoors.positionProvider?.latestPositionResult?.geometry
let destination = MPPoint.init(lat: 57.058038, lon: 9.950509, zValue:0)!
if let origin = userPosition {
    let directionsQuery = MPDirectionsQuery.init(originPoint: origin, destination: destination)
    directions.routing(with: directionsQuery) { (route, error) in
    }
}
```

Often you may want to get directions starting from a user's actual current position, instead of from another fixed Location. This involved using the `PositionControl` class to determine the user's current location, and using the routing API to generate a route to the desired Location. The following code snippet gives an example on how to implement this.

```javascript
// MapsIndoors MapView instantiation, which you should already have
const mapViewInstance = new mapsindoors.mapView.GoogleMapsView(/*...*/);

// MapsIndoors instantiation, which you should already have
const mapsIndoorsInstance = new mapsindoors.MapsIndoors(/*...*/);

// Obtain a reference to the Google map.
const googleMapsInstance = mapViewInstance.getMap();

// Create element to hold the position control
const positionControlElement = document.createElement("div");

// Create position control and attach it to element
const positionControl = new mapsindoors.PositionControl(positionControlElement, {
    mapsIndoors: mapsIndoorsInstance,
});

// Add the element now holding position control to your map
googleMapsInstance.controls[google.maps.ControlPosition.RIGHT_BOTTOM].push(positionControlElement);

// Get the user's current location
let currentLocation;
positionControl.getPosition().then((position) => {
    currentLocation = position;
    // Generate a route to the desired location, using the user's current location as the origin
    mapsIndoorsInstance.routing.getRoute({ origin: currentLocation, destination: desiredLocation }).then((route) => {
        // Render the route on the map
    });
});
```
