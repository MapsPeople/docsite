When getting the resulting Route from a [Directions Service](directions/directions-service/), you may want to display this Route on a map. To perform this task the `MPDirectionsRenderer` can be used.

This example shows how to setup a query for a route and display the result on a Google Map using the `MPDirectionsRenderer`:

```java
void getRoute() {
    MPDirectionsService directionsService = new MPDirectionsService(this);
    MPDirectionsRenderer directionsRenderer = new MPDirectionsRenderer(mMapControl);
    MPPoint origin = new MPPoint(57.057917, 9.950361, 0.0);
    MPPoint destination = new MPPoint(57.058038, 9.950509, 0.0);
    directionsService.setRouteResultListener((route, error) -> {
        if (route != null) {
            directionsRenderer.setRoute(route);
        }
    });
    directionsService.query(origin, destination);
}
```

## Controlling the Visible Segments on the Directions Renderer

As previously mentioned, the route object is seperated into objects of `MPRouteLeg`. Each leg is again separated into objects of `MPRouteStep`. Unless the Route only contains one Leg, the Directions Renderer does not allow the full Route to be rendered all at once. A specific segment of the route can be rendered by setting the `legIndex` on the `MPDirectionsRenderer`

```java
void setLegIndex(int position) {
    mpDirectionsRenderer.selectLegIndex(position);
}
```

The length of the `legs` array from `getLegs` on the `MPRoute` object determines the possible values of `routeLegIndex` (`0 ..< length`).

### Reacting to Label Tapping

**Directions Labels** refer to the labels shown at the end of the rendered route segment path, that may provide contextual information, or show instructions for a required user action at that point. The labels are created as simple `Marker` instances that are rendered as markers on the map. A user is able to long press these, and an event will be forwarded to the listener `OnLegSelectedListener` in `MPDirectionsRenderer`. This can be used to change the Leg to the next Leg in line on the Route.

```java
void getRoute() {
    MPDirectionsService directionsService = new MPDirectionsService(this);
    MPDirectionsRenderer directionsRenderer = new MPDirectionsRenderer(mMapControl);
    MPPoint origin = new MPPoint(57.057917, 9.950361, 0.0);
    MPPoint destination = new MPPoint(57.058038, 9.950509, 0.0);
    directionsService.setRouteResultListener((route, error) -> {
        if (route != null) {
            directionsRenderer.setRoute(route);
        }
    });
    directionsRenderer.setOnLegSelectedListener(i -> {
        directionsRenderer.selectLegIndex(i);
    });
    directionsService.query(origin, destination);
}
```

`MPDirectionsRenderer` also has convenience methods to change the active leg to previous and next Leg.

```java
void nextLeg() {
    mpDirectionsRenderer.nextLeg();
}
void previousLeg() {
    mpDirectionsRenderer.previousLeg();
}
```

## Show Content of Nearby Locations

It is possible to show contextual information on the end points of the rendered path of a route segment by configuring the directions renderer to look for nearby Locations or POIs.

This is done by creating an appropriate `MPContextualInfoSettings` object and passing that to the Directions Renderer. If it is not set or is null, no contextual information will be shown.

The `MPContextualInfoSetting` can be applied on `MPDirectionsRenderer` by calling `useContentOfNearbyLocations(MPContextualInfoSettings)`. Like this:

```java
//Sets the contextual info to be of locations that has the type "entries" and searches within a max distance of 30 meters from the end point of the current route segment
mpDirectionsRenderer.useContentOfNearbyLocations(new MPContextualInfoSettings.Builder()
        .setTypes(Collections.singletonList("entries"))
        .setMaxDistance(30.0)
        .build());
```

The defaults of the `ContextualInfoSettings` builder are `maxDistance` at 5 meters and the `ContextualInfoScope` as icon and name. No Types or Categories are set as default. Not applying any Types or Categories will make it search through all Locations to use as contextual information.

When getting the result Route from a [Directions Service](/directions-service/), we may want to display this Route on a map. To perform this task the `MPDirectionsRenderer` can be used.

This example shows how to setup a query for a route and display the result on a Google Map using the `MPDirectionsRenderer`:

```swift
let directions = MPDirectionsService.init()
let renderer = MPDirectionsRenderer.init()
renderer.fitBounds = true
renderer.delegate = self

let origin = MPPoint.init(lat: 57.057917, lon: 9.950361, zValue:0)
let destination = MPPoint.init(lat: 57.058038, lon: 9.950509, zValue:0)

let directionsQuery = MPDirectionsQuery.init(originPoint: origin!, destination: destination!)

directions.routing(with: directionsQuery) { (route, error) in
    renderer.map = self.map
    renderer.route = route
    renderer.routeLegIndex = 0
    renderer.animate(5)
}
```

## Controlling the Visible Segments on the Directions Renderer

As previously mentioned, the route object is seperated into objects of `MPRouteLeg` and these legs are again seperated indo objects of `MPRouteStep`. Unless the Route only contains one Leg, the Directions Renderer does not allow the full Route to be rendered all at once. A specific segment of the route can be rendered by setting the `routeLegIndex` and/or `routeStepIndex` properties on the `MPDirectionsRenderer`.

```swift
let renderer = MPDirectionsRenderer.init()
renderer.routeLegIndex = 0
renderer.routeStepIndex = 1
```

The length of the `legs` and `steps` arrays determines the possible values of `routeLegIndex` and `routeStepIndex` (`0 ..< length`).

## Reacting to Directions Renderer Events

Assigning a `MPDirectionsRenderer` delegate will make it possible to know which floor the currently rendered part of the route belongs to. As such, you may want to change the currently visible floor on `MPMapControl` like shown in the example below.

```swift
func floorDidChange(_ floor: NSNumber!) {
    mapControl?.currentFloor = floor
}
```

### Reacting to Label Tapping

The Directions Labels refer to labels shown at the start and/or end of the rendered route segment (leg or step) path, that may provide contextual information or show instructions for the needed user action at that point. E.g. the end label can be retrieved with `.nextRouteLegButton`. The labels are created as simple `UIButton` instances that are rendered as markers on the map. As with most buttons, it is possible to add targets to these labels, so you can react to touch events.

```swift

override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    let renderer = MPDirectionsRenderer.init()
    renderer.delegate = self
    renderer.map = self.map

    renderer.nextRouteLegButton?.addTarget(self, action: #selector(nextLeg), for: .touchUpInside)
    renderer.previousRouteLegButton?.addTarget(self, action: #selector(previousLeg), for: .touchUpInside)
}

@objc func nextLeg() {
    renderer.routeLegIndex += 1
}

@objc func previousLeg() {
    renderer.routeLegIndex -= 1
}

```

In the above example, a target is added to `nextRouteLegButton` and  `nextRouteLegButton` calling the method `nextLeg` and `previousLeg` respectively. These methods then changes the visible Route Leg.

## Show Content of Nearby Locations

It is possible to show contextual information on the start or end points of the rendered path of a route segment by configuring the directions renderer to look for nearby Locations or POIs.

This is done by creating an appropriate `MPDirectionsRendererContextualInfoSettings` object and passing it to the directions renderer. If the `contextualInfoSettings` property is not set, no contextual information will be searched for and shown.

```swift
class MPDirectionsRendererContextualInfoSettings {
    // The Types of Location that should be used when showing text and icon for a start or end marker.
    // If no Types are supplied, all Types of Locations will be considered.
    var types: [String]?

    // The Categories of Location that should be used when showing text and icon for a start or end marker.
    // If no Categories are supplied, all Categories of Locations will be considered.
    var categories: [String]?

    // The maximum distance in meters allowed for using text and icon from a Location. Leave blank for a default of 5 meters.
    var maxDistance: Double

    // Which content should be used. Default is IconAndName.
    var contentScope: MPDirectionsRendererContextualInfoScope
}
```

Possible values for `contentScope` are `IconAndName` (default), `IconOnly`, or `NameOnly` as defined in `MPDirectionsRendererContextualInfoScope`.

This is an example of how to show information about Locations of Type "Entry" within 20 meters from the route, with both an icon and the name:

```swift
let contextualSettings = DirectionsRendererContextualInfoSettings()
contextualSettings.types = ["Entry"]
contextualSettings.maxDistance = 20
myDirectionsRenderer.contextualInfoSettings = contextualSettings
```

As previously mentioned, the route object is separated into objects of [`Leg`](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/js/sdk/latest/docs/Leg.html) and these legs are again separated into objects of [`Step`](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/js/sdk/latest/docs/Step.html). Unless the Route only contains one Leg, the Directions Renderer does not allow the full Route to be rendered all at once. A specific part of the route can be rendered by setting the step index and/or leg index using the `DirectionsRenderer`.
