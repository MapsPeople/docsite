Welcome to the MapsIndoors SDK Getting Started guide! If you're a new customer of MapsIndoors, this is probably where you're going to want to start.

The first major step is ensuring that your maps are in our CMS. Please contact your MapsIndoors representative to ensure that they are already there, or at leats on their way.

Secondly, you will need to decide which platform you wish to develop for. We support 3 platforms, Android, iOS and a web platform, which uses Javascript. Many customers choose to develop for both Android and iOS, and often a web-based solution too, but only you can determine your needs in this area. Once you have decided, please use the sidebar on the left to navigate to your desired platform!

You will probably notice that the Android SDK has multiple versions. We will in nearly any scenario recommend using the latest version, in this case Android V4.
